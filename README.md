# Footbal Analytics 

## Developed as a project at University "La Sapienza" of Rome 
### September 2019

The final file with all Football Analytics produced is **main.ipynb**. 

We used data from the major European leagues in 2018 by selecting and analysing those referring to teams, coaches and events in the English Premier League. 

1) Using the csv of the "events" we identified the teams with the longest winning and losing streaks, and we plotted a final graph to summarise the points each team achieved during the whole season. 
2) We checked on 5 teams if there is a real home-field adavantage, counting their draws, losses and wins and checking with the p-value  the null hypothesis that there is no advantage.
3) We merged teams and coaches csv files to identify which team has the youngest one, computing their agest from the date of birth.
4) We used the "events" csv to identify the player with the best statistics on attempted and successful passes
5) We checked the correlation between air duels and height
6) We checked the correlation between passess ratio and points of a team
7) Considering the match Barcelona - Real Madrid played on the 6 May 2018 we stored Cristiano and Messi events producing their heatmaps
8) Considering the match Juventus - Napoli played on the 22 April 2018 we stored heatmaps and sucessful passes for Pjanic and Jorginho
